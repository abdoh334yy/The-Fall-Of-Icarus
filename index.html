  <li> "The Fall Of Icrarus" is a Greek mythology about a father and son , they were prisoners in the island of crete . so they planned to escape by an usual way . they started to collect fallen feathers from bird and by some wax they made the Wings to escape . and it surprisingly worked the father "Daedalus" and his son "Icarus" successfully had escaped Crete .  </li><br>
  <li>As they was flying in the sky Icarus was trying to fly higher and higher his father warned him not to fly so high or the son will melt the wax on the wings but icarus didn't care about anything. The feeling of freedom , youth , And happiness all this feelings inside him made him fly beyond everything . </li><br>
  <li>Icarus spread his wings , at first he was hesitant and careful but his fear washed away as he went up in the clear blue sky . Icarus was so intruiged and charmed by hte wide sky that encased him as he glided through the fresh winf and warm sunbeams. he was so high up looking directly at the sun and so fell in love with it and the weightlessness of his flight so mush that he forget about life and death he didn't realize the hot wax from his wings dripping down his shoulders and back feathers started swirling around him , But he was so hypnotized by the sun and so suddnly his wings collapsed and he flew one last time , as he flew directly towards the sea he laughted . He fell in love with the sun , he wasn't scared of looking into death's eyes because he never felt that alive before . He was happy to die in this pure happiness and so he crashed into the ocean smiling Not for one second turning away from the sun and so he died with broken wings but a fulfilled soul. </li><br>
  <li>"The Fall Of Icarus" has alot of meanings and feelings , feeling alive no matter what it'll cost , feeling the pleasure of life , things like purpose , humanity , love and kindess....it's what makes us humans..it's what makes us ALIVE  </li><br>
